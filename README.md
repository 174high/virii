Collection of ancient computer virus source codes (mostly). 
There should be around 2000 files in this repository with a few being Pascal source codes or assembled [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_file) files. A portion of the source codes are also result of reverse engineering and 
most if not all of it were created for DOS and/or Win9x.

I had this files laying around an old hard drive since ages ago and decided to share.

The content of this repository is for educational purposes, I am not responsible for the misuse of it.
